# Final Report

## Introduction and literature review

### Data Source information:

- The data was downloaded from Kaggle, which is originally from NASA's Magellan spacecraft database.
- Kaggle. https://www.kaggle.com/amantheroot/finding-volcanoes-on-venus/data

### Data introduction:

9734 images were captured by the spacecraft and converted to pixel (110x110, from 0 to 255), where every image is one row of 12100 columns (all the 110 rows of 110 columns). Images can contain more than one volcanoes or maybe none.
The 9000+ images are separated to four datasets (file names : *train_images*, *train_labels*, *test_images*, and *test_labels*):

#### Image dataset (*train_images* and *test_images*)
*Train_images* : 7000 images as train data with 12100 variables;  
*Test_images* : 2734 images as test data with 12100 variables; 
All the variables correspond to the pixel image, 110 pixel * 110 pixel = 12100.

#### Label dataset (*tain_labels* and *test_labels*)
Both *train_labels* and *test_label* datasets include the following labels:   
1. *Volcano?* : if in the image there are volcanoes (Main target), 1 (yes) or 0 (no)  
(If Volcano? = 0, the following three categories would be "nan")  
2. *Type* : 1= definitely a volcano,2 =probably, 3= possibly, 4= only a pit is visible   
3. *Radius* : is the radius of the volcano in the center of the image, in pixels   
4. *Number Volcanoes* : The number of volcanoes in the image  
For this project, we will focus mainly on predicting whether each image has a volcanoe or not. In addition, if the classification prediction goes well, we will also construct model to predict the number of volcanoes in the images. 

### Scientific goal:

We aim in constructing classification model to predict whether there exist a valcano through image.  

We aim in constructing mainly classification model to predict whether there exist a valcano through image. If the classification model works well, we will continue to further doing analysis based on the images which we identify as containing at least one volcano to predict the number of volcanoes in the images.
